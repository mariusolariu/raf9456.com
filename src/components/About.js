        WHAT WE ARE <strong>(PURPOSE)</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        We are a unique members’ organisation that has thrived for over 300
        years. Having no political or religious affiliations, we comprise
        members of all ages, races, religions, cultures and backgrounds. We meet
        in our individual Lodges throughout the country where we have ceremonial
        traditions which encourage us both to be more tolerant and respectful
        and actively to fulfil our civic and charitable responsibilities; we
        also make time to eat, drink and meet together, and form lifelong
        friendships.
      </p>

      <h4>WHAT WE AIM FOR (VISION)</h4>
      <p>
        To attract those from all backgrounds and walks of life, enabling them
        to develop into more thoughtful and confident people. To inspire and
        challenge them to practise the core values we celebrate – Integrity,
        Friendship, Respect, Service– in their private and public lives. To
        cement our reputation as a force for good in our communities and society
        at large and as a thriving organisation that people aspire to join.
      </p>

      <h4>HOW WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS (MISSION)</h4>
      <br></br>

      <p>
        &nbsp; Over the next 7 years, we will enhance our reputation as a
        thriving organisation that people aspire to join and broaden our
        membership across all age groups.
